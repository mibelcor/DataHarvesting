# Comparing Menstrual Product Accessibility in Spanish Supermarkets
## Description
Menstrual poverty affects millions of women by limiting access to basic products like pads and tampons. In Spain, 2 out of 10 women experience this issue, worsened by rising prices.

This project compares menstrual products in DIA and Alcampo supermarkets using web scraping, analyzing:

- Product type

- Price

- Brand

- Description

- Quantity

The goal is to identify more affordable options and raise awareness of this issue.

## How it works
Simply download the script and run it after installing the required libraries (listed in the dependencies section).

Keep in mind that, due to the dynamic nature of the websites, their internal structure may occasionally change. This could affect how the scraper works and cause errors during execution.

In such cases, manual adjustments to the scraping logic might be needed to adapt to the new site structure.
