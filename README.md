# Menstrual poverty - Data Harvesting

Menstrual poverty affects millions of women by limiting access to basic products like pads and tampons. In Spain, 2 out of 10 women experience this issue, worsened by rising prices.

This project compares menstrual products in DIA and Alcampo supermarkets using web scraping, analyzing:

- Product type

- Price

- Brand

- Description

- Quantity

The goal is to identify more affordable options and raise awareness of this issue.
